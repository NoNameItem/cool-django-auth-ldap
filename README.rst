Readme
======

This is fork of django-auth-ldap 2.0.0. I tried to save all original features while adding few new ones. In 95% original documentation is still applies,
just replace package name `django_auth_ldap` to `cool_django_auth_ldap`. All changes described in this readme.

Original documentation: https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/
